Abstract
Churners have always been a big issue for any service providing company. Churning 
increases cost of the company as well as decreases the rate of profit. The aim of our 
project is to analysis the customers past service usage, service performance, spending 
and other behaviour patterns, the likelihood of whether a customer wants to terminate 
service can be determined and predict whether a customer will churn in the near future 
or not based on the predictive analysis using billing data of a telecom company. And 
we will be doing a complete EDA process to determine if the customer from that 
particular telecom industry will leave that telecom service or not meanwhile, we will 
draw some insights from data visualization and analysis in PowerBi
